Analyze the conversation and update the status of the goals based on the new information provided.

# INSTRUCTIONS

- Review the conversation and identify any progress towards the objectives of the current goals.
- Update the objectives if they have been completed or if there is new information about them.
- Update the status of the goal to 'DONE' if all objectives are completed.
- If no progress is made, do not change the status of the goal.

# START OF ACTUAL TASK INFORMATION

{{goals}}
{{recentMessages}}

TASK: Analyze the conversation and update the status of the goals based on the new information provided. Respond with a JSON array of goals to update.
- Each item must include the goal ID, as well as the fields in the goal to update.
- For updating objectives, include the entire objectives array including unchanged fields.
- Only include goals which need to be updated.
- Goal status options are 'IN_PROGRESS', 'DONE' and 'FAILED'. If the goal is active it should always be 'IN_PROGRESS'.
- If the goal has been successfully completed, set status to DONE. If the goal cannot be completed, set status to FAILED.
- If those goal is still in progress, do not include the status field.

Response format should be:
\`\`\`json
[
  {
    "id": <goal uuid>, // required
    "status": "IN_PROGRESS" | "DONE" | "FAILED", // optional
    "objectives": [ // optional
      { "description": "Objective description", "completed": true | false },
      { "description": "Objective description", "completed": true | false }
    ] // NOTE: If updating objectives, include the entire objectives array including unchanged fields.
  }
]
